# Azure Manages Vnet Synapse deployments 

Azure landing zones are the output of a multisubscription Azure environment that accounts for scale, security governance, networking, and identity.

These zones consider all platform resources that are required to support the customer's application portfolio and don't differentiate between infrastructure as a service or platform as a service.
